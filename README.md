- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andreramone
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in TECNOLOGY, WEB DEVELOPMENT, COMICS, COLLECTIBLES AND MORE!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript and ReactJS


My name is AndrÃ© Luiz Wanderley Ramone, i am an lawyer passionate about tecnology, i graduated on law school at 2018 and started working at JUNTA COMERCIAL DO ESTADO DA BAHIA.
However, in the pandemic 2020, i was pretty unhappy with my job and started to wonder what could i do to change that.
On early 2021 i was watching my brother's work as a software developer in a company and i was amazed! then i realize that despite i liked being an lawyer, my true passion lies
on Software Develpment, specially web development.
So i started to pursuit this dream and i started to learn programming logic and in a blink of an eye i started to create my own projects using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
After a few months, i started to learn some other tecnologies like NodeJs and ReactJs, and some database languages such as SQL and MariaDB.
I was a volunteer for a few months at a tecnology company that taught me a lot about web programming
My dream from now on is to quit my job as a lawyer and begin my carrer as a junior web developer.
